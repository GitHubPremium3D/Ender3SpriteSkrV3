This is my best effort to get my Ender 3 up and running. Please see the printer.cfg for more information.

Setup pi with mainsail OS and manually added KAMP. 
Find your printer.cfg and board from klipper github. Printer=Ender3 Board=SKR mini E3 V3 
Find 5 similar examples. I had to find Ender3 examples with the sprite extruder.
Board example was saved as printer.cfg and adjusted with the printer examples to show accurate rotation and bed limitations as well as other configurations.
Added macro files in the same folder as my printer.cfg but not in that file. Added [include x_macro.cfg] moving KAMP files to the same location.
Adjusted mainsail to fit my needs.
Ran a few bed leveling and calibrated from prints. 
You can find my setup files included here as well as my macros.

Still a work in progress but getting better quickly.
More information in the printer.cfg file here.
